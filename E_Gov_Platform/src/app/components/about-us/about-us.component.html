        myScheme is a National Platform that aims to offer one-stop search and
        discovery of the Government schemes. <br><br> It provides an innovative,
        technology-based solution to discover scheme information based upon the
        eligibility of the citizen.  <br><br>   The platform helps the citizen to find the right
        Government schemes for them. It also guides on how to apply for different
        Government schemes. Thus no need to visit multiple Government websites. <br><br>
        myScheme platform is Developed, Managed, and Operated by National
        e-Governance Division (NeGD), with the Support of Ministry of Electronics
        and Information Technology (MeitY), Department of Administrative Reforms and
        Public Grievance (DARPG) and in partnership with other Central and State
        Ministries/Departments.
